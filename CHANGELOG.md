# Project Prizmora - Changelog

This document summarizes the key changes, implementations, and fixes made to the Prizmora project.

## 1. Initial Feature Implementation: Zora & IPFS

*   **Zora Integration Foundation:**
    *   Created `lib/zora.ts` to house Zora SDK functionalities (coin creation, fetching coin data).
    *   Defined TypeScript types for Zora data structures in `types/zora.ts`.
*   **IPFS Integration Foundation:**
    *   Initially set up placeholder IPFS upload logic.
*   **API Routes:**
    *   `app/api/ipfs/upload/route.ts`: For uploading files to IPFS.
    *   `app/api/ipfs/upload-json/route.ts`: For uploading JSON metadata to IPFS.
    *   `app/api/coins/route.ts`: For handling coin-related operations (fetching trending, new, user coins).

## 2. Dependency Management & Conflict Resolution

*   **`package.json` Updates:**
    *   Resolved `react-day-picker` version conflict with React 19 by upgrading `react-day-picker` from `v8.10.1` to `^9.0.0`.
    *   Corrected `pinata-web3` version from `^0.0.7` (not found) to `^0.5.4`.
    *   Removed unused/unnecessary dependencies:
        *   Expo and React Native related packages.
        *   `crypto` (Node.js built-in, explicit dependency not typically needed in Next.js frontend).
    *   Added `pinata-web3` for Pinata IPFS service.
    *   Initially included `web3.storage`, which was later superseded by `pinata-web3` but might remain in `package.json` if not explicitly removed after the switch.
*   **Instructions:** Advised running `pnpm install` to apply dependency changes.

## 3. IPFS Service Migration & Refinement

*   **Switched IPFS Provider:**
    *   Transitioned from an initial Web3.Storage setup to Pinata for IPFS services.
*   **`lib/ipfs.ts` Refactoring:**
    *   Updated to use `PinataSDK` from `pinata-web3`.
    *   Implemented functions using `PINATA_JWT` and `PINATA_GATEWAY` environment variables for authentication and access.
    *   Simplified Pinata upload calls (`pinata.upload.file()` and `pinata.upload.json()`) by removing the `UploadOptions` argument that was causing type issues, relying on `File.name` and SDK defaults.
*   **API Route Updates for IPFS:**
    *   Modified `app/api/ipfs/upload/route.ts` and `app/api/ipfs/upload-json/route.ts` to utilize the abstracted Pinata functions from `lib/ipfs.ts`.

## 4. Zora SDK Integration in API Routes

*   **`app/api/coins/route.ts` Refactor:**
    *   Resolved a circular dependency issue where `lib/zora.ts` called API routes which in turn might have called `lib/zora.ts`.
    *   The API route now directly uses Zora SDK functions for fetching coin data.
*   **Zora SDK Function Usage:**
    *   Implemented `getCoinsNew` for fetching newly created coins.
    *   Implemented `getCoinsTopGainers` for fetching trending coins.
    *   Functionality for fetching "user" specific coins was identified as a TODO, requiring further investigation into the appropriate Zora SDK profile query function.
*   **Helper Function Improvement:**
    *   Enhanced the robustness of the `adaptToCoinDetails` helper function.

## 5. Type Definitions and Corrections

*   **`lib/zora.ts`:**
    *   Corrected imports for `WalletClient` and `PublicClient` from `wagmi` to `viem`.
    *   Removed an unused `GetCoinsParameters` import.
*   **`types/zora.ts`:**
    *   Adjusted the `CoinCreationResult` type: made the `blockNumber` field optional within the `deployment` object to align with the actual data structure returned by the Zora `createCoin` SDK function.

## 6. Project Review and Code Fixes

*   **`app/layout.tsx`:**
    *   Removed a duplicate import of `globals.css`.
    *   Noted a redundant empty `<head />` tag (Next.js typically manages head content).
*   **`app/api/upload-to-cloudinary/route.ts`:**
    *   Corrected a hardcoded MIME type for Cloudinary uploads; it now dynamically uses `imageBlob.type`.
    *   Noted potential SSRF risk and inefficient re-reading of `request.json()` in the error handler (these specific items were not fixed during the session).
*   **`components/share-modal.tsx`:**
    *   Addressed a critical prop mismatch for `ZoraCoinCreator`:
        *   The modal now fetches the `imageUrl` (string) and converts it into a `File` object before passing it to `ZoraCoinCreator`.
        *   Implemented loading and error states for this image preparation process.
    *   Noted unused `caption` state and an `alert()` for Instagram sharing.
*   **`package.json` (from review):**
    *   Confirmed removal of Expo/React Native and `crypto` dependencies.
    *   Noted the use of `"latest"` for some package versions (can lead to unexpected updates).
    *   Noted the presence of both `web3.storage` and `pinata-web3` (the former might be redundant).
*   **Other Noted Issues:**
    *   `app/api/generate-image/route.ts`: Incomplete Gemini implementation, mock URL, potential prompt truncation, SSRF risk.
    *   `lib/api-utils.ts`: SSRF risk in `encodeImageToBase64`, potential `FileReader` issues in Edge runtime, unreliable MIME type detection, generic image descriptions.
    *   `app/page.tsx`: Suggestions for using `next/image`, making help button functional, checking copyright year.
    *   `hooks/use-toast.ts`: Very long `TOAST_REMOVE_DELAY`.

## Remaining Tasks & Considerations

*   Implement robust SSRF validation across all relevant API routes and utility functions.
*   Complete the "user coins" fetching functionality in `app/api/coins/route.ts` by identifying and implementing the correct Zora SDK function.
*   Address other medium/minor points from the project review (e.g., Gemini implementation, `api-utils` improvements, UI suggestions).
